Waste Classification Project

This project involves two deep learning models for waste classification. The first model classifies waste as either biodegradable or non-biodegradable, and the second model classifies waste into specific categories: glass, paper, light bulb, plastic, metal, batteries, e-waste, and clothes. The models are built using popular deep learning architectures: VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3.

Usage



Proper waste classification is essential for effective recycling and waste management. This project aims to leverage deep learning techniques to automate the process of classifying waste. The project includes two models:

Binary Classification Model: Classifies waste as either biodegradable or non-biodegradable.
Multi-class Classification Model: Classifies waste into specific categories: glass, paper, light bulb, plastic, metal, batteries, e-waste, and clothes.

Model Architectures
We have utilized three state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for our models:

VGG16
ResNet50
InceptionV3
These architectures are pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on our specific waste classification datasets.
